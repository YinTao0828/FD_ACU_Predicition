# FD_ACU_Predicition
This code was applied to predict the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for functional dyspepsia with routine clinical features and SVM
People could prepare features based on test data and prospectively predict the efficacy of acupuncture on new subjects based on these 28 features and the trained SVM model.
The code "FD_ACUresponse" was apllied to predict the acupuncture response of FD patients
The code "FD_ACU_NDLQI" was apllied to predict the improvement of NDLQI of FD patients
The code "FD_ACU_NDSI" was apllied to predict the improvement of NDSI of FD patients
These three .mat file named "model_testdata", "model_testdata_NDLQI" and "model_testdata_NDSI" contained the traind prediction models and the test data.
These 28 feature included the gender, age, Body Mass Index, education level, and marriage status, subtype of disease, duration (by month), 15 sub-scores and the total score of the baseline NDSI, and 4 dimensional scores and the overall mean score of the NDLQI.
